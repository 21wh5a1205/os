Round Robin:
 Similar to FCFS, but preemption to switch between processes
 Time quantum(time slice) is a small unit of time (10 to 100 ms)
 Process is executed on the CPU for at most one-time quantum
 Implemented by using the ready queue as a circular queue
 Head process gets the CPU
 Uses less than a time quantum implies gives up the CPU voluntary
 Uses full time quantum implies timer will cause an interrupt
 Context switch will be executed
 Process will be put at the tail of queue
 Preemptive
