Short job first:
 Solution to the Convoy Effect problem.
 Assume the next burst time of each process is known
 SJF selects process which has the shortest burst time
 Optimal algorithm because it has the shortest average waiting time
 Equal burst time processes are scheduled in FCFS order
 Impossible to know in advance
 OS knows the past burst times- make a prediction using an average
 Non-preemptive Or preemptive
