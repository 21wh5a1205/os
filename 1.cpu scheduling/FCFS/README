First come first serve
 First-come, First served is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
 Ready queue is a FIFO queue.
 Longest waiting process at the front of queue.
 New ready processes join the rear.
 Non-preemptive: executes until voluntarily gives up CPU finished or waits for some event.
 Convoy Effect Problem: CPU bound process may execute a long CPU burst processes, so the
processes with very short CPU bursts, wait in queue Reduces CPU and I/O device utilization.
